# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
 
## Overview of the Pewlett-Hackard Challenge 

- Through this module we are assisting in gathering data on potentially retiring employees, the great Silver Tsunami.  

### Purpose

- The purpose of this challenge was to provide data to Pewlett-Hackard on their aging workforce. We created queries to gather the data from the provided databases to generate a potential plan of action for the future. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes 

- We learned that there is infact a large number of potential staff members who are eligible to retire or will be eligible soon through further investigation. 
- We used the data we were provided and parsed through it with the use of pgAdmin and PostgreSQL. 
- With that data we are able to find that approximately 30% of the staff members will be potentially retiring soon. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

- The main difficulties I encountered through this challenge was the new syntax, there are a few different terms to use although the logic is relatable to the previous languages we used.

## Results

- The data shows that Pewlett-Hackard's workforce is majority senior members, a little over 50%. This is a very pressing matter as this is a significant number of talent potentially leaving the company through retirement alone. The mentorship program should be implemented as soon as possible to bolster the younger workforce to maintain or possibly emprove the available talent within the organization.
